## Document Organization and Hierarchy

You create a clear hierarchy with parent-child pages, folders, and sections. This mirrors your project's structure, making navigation intuitive.

    A[Root Docs] --> B[Getting Started]
    A --> C[API Reference]
    B --> D[Installation]
    B --> E[Quickstart]
    C --> F[Endpoints]
    C --> G[Authentication]
```

Use the sidebar to drag and drop pages. Nest up to five levels deep for complex projects.

  ````
  ```javascript

  const history = await fetch('https://api.comparetech.com/docs/project/versions', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` }
